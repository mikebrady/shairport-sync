# This is an improved workflow for building and pushing Docker images.
#
# Key Improvements from last version:
# 1. Sequential Jobs: The 'build-and-push' job now uses 'needs: [sync-fork]' to wait
#    for the sync to complete, ensuring builds use the latest code.
# 2. Correct Checkout: The 'build-and-push' job now re-checks out the branch after the
#    sync to get the newly fetched code.
# 3. Smarter 'if' conditions: Jobs now run only when appropriate.
# 4. Schedule Restored: The 'schedule' trigger has been added back to automate the sync.
